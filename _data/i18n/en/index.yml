# grant
grant-head: Grant
grant-text: The senseBox was developed at the University of Münster as part of a research project at the Institute for Geoinformatics. Thanks to various funding from different sponsors, the idea was able to mature further and further. Over a period of three years, until the end of 2019, the "BMBF Open Photonics" funding in particular provided significant support for the further development of the senseBox. Even during this period, the chance of a successful spin-off of the product division became apparent, which was followed by the founding of Reedu GmbH & Co. KG. This spin-off was additionally promoted with an EXIST start-up grant from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. In order to continue researching innovative ideas related to the senseBox, the association of spin-off companies and university was able to successfully apply for another project in the field of "Photonics Research Germany". Since November 2019, the "senseBox:pro" research project has been one of several projects in the "Open Photonik Pro" funding measure. With this measure, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is pursuing the goal of enabling new forms of cooperation between science and industry with the maker and founder scene.
