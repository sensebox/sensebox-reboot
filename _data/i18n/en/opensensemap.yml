head-2: Analyze environmental data
text-2: OpenSenseMap gives you access to <b>billions</b> of measurements. View historical measurements, create simple graphs, compare measurements from different locations, or download the data to your computer for analysis.

head-3: Open API
text-3: The open API provides access to all sensor data for use in other systems. For example, environmental data is visualized in an exhibit at the Futurium museum in Berlin, and web platforms such as ArcGIS Online offer direct access to the measured values. In addition to sensor data from the senseBox, other measuring devices, such as those from the projects luftdaten.info or HackAir, can also send their measured values to the openSenseMap.
