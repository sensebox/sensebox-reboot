aqset-co2-headline: "SCD30 - The CO₂ Sensor"
aqset-co2-text: "In addition to CO₂ detection, the same sensor module uses a humidity and temperature sensor to compensate for gas measurements. The CO₂ sensor is designed to automatically compensate for long-term drifts thanks to the two-channel principle used to measure the carbon dioxide concentration."
aqset-sps30-headline: "SPS30 - The particular matter Sensor"
aqset-sps30-text: "Precise fine dust sensor from the Swiss company Sensirion, also suitable for detecting ultrafine particles with particle size PM1.0, as well as a finer subdivision into four particle sizes possible (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4 and PM10)"

aqset-project1-headline: "Measure photosynthetic performance"
aqset-project1-text: "This project aims to illustrate the principle of photosynthesis by measuring the CO₂ content in a closed vessel containing a plant and displaying the data graphically on the senseBox display. Due to the conversion of CO₂ into oxygen, the CO₂ content should decrease."
aqset-project2-headline: "IoT CO2-Ampel"
aqset-project2-text: "In this project, you will learn how to transfer data from your CO₂ traffic light to openSenseMap. This will make your CO₂ traffic light part of a citizen science project, allowing you to compare your room's air quality with that of many others."
