boards-title: "senseBox: Boards"
boards-text: "The centerpiece of any project with the senseBox is an Arduino-compatible microcontroller to which various sensors and data transmission modules can be connected. Depending on the needs and application, there are different versions with special features: the senseBox MCU, the senseBox MCU mini, and the senseBox MCU-S2. The following introduces these three boards."

boards-MCU-title: "The senseBox MCU"
boards-MCU-text: "The senseBox MCU (MicroControllerUnit) is the heart of every senseBox. It is a single-board computer based on the ARM Cortex-M0 processor from the SAMD21 family. This processor makes the senseBox MCU fully compatible with Arduino.<br>It has the following built-in ports and components."
