edu-text: "The senseBox:edu is your all-round carefree package for the entry into the world of microcontrollers and programming. The senseBox:edu offers the largest hardware range in the senseBox:family and thus enables a huge selection of projects and experiments. All components are located in a robust plastic case with foam inlay. So you are perfectly prepared for the use in school."

edu-material-title: "Teaching and learning materials"
edu-material-text: "The senseBox:edu includes not only the hardware but also a variety of materials. From projects to reproduce, to teaching ideas, to classification in educational standards, you can find everything free of charge on our website. 
The collection of materials is constantly being revised and new projects are added, so it's worth taking a look from time to time."

edu-programming-title: "Easy programming"
edu-programming-text: "The senseBox is programmed using the graphical programming interface Blockly for senseBox. This offers blocks for all components and functions of the senseBox, from which a program can be assembled in no time at all - completely without working on the source code! The programming interface is freely available on the web, requires no software or driver installation and therefore no maintenance.<br> In addition, the senseBox can be programmed with the help of NEPO, the graphical programming interface of the Fraunhofer Institute IAIS. For advanced applications, the senseBox:edu can also be programmed directly in the Arduino IDE."

edu-content-title: "Content"
edu-content-text: "The senseBox:edu has the largest hardware range in the senseBox:family. It offers the possibility to measure temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, brightness, UV intensity, distances and noise and display them on the OLED display. In addition to the sensors, it also contains a WiFi and an mSD card module for transferring or storing data, as well as a range of small parts for exciting experiments."
