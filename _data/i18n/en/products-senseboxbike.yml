title: senseBox:bike
bike-text: "The senseBox:bike expands the focus on environmental monitoring to include the component of road safety for cyclists. With a kit that can be mounted on the bicycle saddle, statements can thus be made about the condition of the cycle path, the distance between the bicycle and the car, and the speed of the cyclist. The following sensors and components are available for this purpose"
bike-phenomenon-title: "Measurable Phenomena"
bike-phenomenon-text: "The following phenomena can be measured with the senseBox:bike mobil."
phenomenon-temperature: temperature
phenomenon-humidity: relative humidity
phenomenon-pm: fine dust (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4 & PM10)
phenomenon-acceleration: vibration
phenomenon-speed: speed
phenomenon-distance: Distance (to the left)
phenomenon-text: "The senseBox:bike measures the phenomena listed below to capture both the bicycle infrastructure and the hazards faced by cyclists on the road."
bike-transmission-title: "The data transmission"
bike-transmission-text: "Data is transferred from the smartphone to the internet via an app that is connected to the senseBox:bike via Bluetooth. The data is uploaded from the smartphone to the openSenseMap (opensSenseMap.org). Through the participation of many citizens, a comprehensive picture of the city's cycling infrastructure can be determined. Participants can make privacy settings in the app, such as an individually defined radius around their own home. No data is then recorded in this area."
bike-app-title: "The senseBox:bike app"
bike-app-text: "With the senseBox:bike app, the data from the senseBox:bike can be recorded and transferred to the openSenseMap. In addition, live values from the senseBox:bike and the route travelled are displayed. The app is available for Android and iOS."
bike-housing-title: "The Enclosure"
bike-housing-text: "The housing of the senseBox:bike has been designed so that it can be effortlessly attached to almost any bike and just as easily removed again. This versatile design has been developed to fulfil the requirements of different types of bike. An integrated small fan ensures pleasant ventilation so that your senseBox:bike always functions optimally. Easy to fit, easy to remove and suitable for a wide range of bikes - the senseBox:bike remains flexible and comfortable in every respect."
bike-example-title: "An example: Meals on Wheels"
bike-example-text-link: "In this project"
bike-example-text: "Pupils from five schools in Essen are independently collecting data with the senseBox:bike. This data serves as a basis for analysing the cycling infrastructure of the city of Essen, identifying danger spots and finally developing suggestions for improvement based on this data. In a final step, the students discuss the findings with local politicians and are thus motivated to actively participate in urban planning processes with the help of Citizen Science"
