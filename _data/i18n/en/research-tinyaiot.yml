idea: "The idea"
idea-text: "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things fueled the design of devices that are based on microcontrollers, equipped with sensors, and capable of exchanging data. These devices - used, e.g., in smart home applications or to build environmental monitoring stations - enable the collection and analysis of large amounts of data and the development of potentially powerful applications. However, applications are currently limited by the need to exchange collected data via cloud services to use state-of-the-art AI processes, which consumes significant resources in the form of energy, material, and bandwidth. The aim of the TinyAIoT project is to reduce these resource requirements by developing efficient and tiny AI models that can be used on the microcontrollers themselves. This not only extends the range of possible use cases to more powerful applications, but also reduces the required bandwidth of applications, enabling microcontrollers to operate autonomously for several weeks to years."
main-goal: "main-goal"
main-goal-text: "The TinyAI research direction aims at significantly reducing the resource requirements of AI processes. If a sufficiently large reduction succeeds, AI procedures may even be able to be executed on microcontrollers. The goal of the TinyAIoT project is to further reduce the resource requirements of existing AI procedures and to adapt further models accordingly. In doing so, the methods will be incorporated into the adaptation and extension of senseBox, an open-source environmental monitoring station, enabling 'smart' microcontrollers that can operate autonomously (battery-supported) for extended periods of time."

Together with various associated project partners, the potential of these senseBoxes will be investigated in the context of three IoT application areas: (a) nature and ecosystems (e.g., smart bird counting), (b) agriculture 4.0 (e.g., smart irrigation systems), and (c) smart cities (e.g., smart parking lot monitoring)."
ressource-efficiency: "Resource efficiency"
ressource-efficiency-text: "The main goal of the TinyAIoT project is to further reduce the resource requirements of existing implementations and to adapt further AI models accordingly. In particular, the resource and energy requirements are to be reduced to such an extent that the underlying microcontrollers can be operated autonomously by means of batteries over a longer period of time. A special focus shall be on the special combination of microcontrollers of the Arduino family and the LoRaWAN network protocol (e.g. very small main memory and limited bandwidth of LoRaWAN). The results will eventually be used to adapt and extend the senseBox and associated sensor networks, leading to a 'smart' version of the senseBox -the TinyAI-senseBox- that can be operated autonomously for longer periods of time Combination"
resource-efficiency-potential: "Potential for resource efficiency."
resource-efficiency-potential-text-1: "The market for IoT applications has already grown rapidly, and the number of microcontrollers is expected to increase sharply in the future. More efficient implementation of the processes and the associated energy savings thus offer the potential to reduce energy consumption for a large proportion of such devices and thus make a significant contribution to saving CO2 emissions. In addition, intelligent microcontrollers will enable numerous applications relevant to the environment and nature, such as in the fields of Agriculture 4.0 and Smart Grids, or in the field of ecosystems."
resource-efficiency-potential-example-title: "Exemplary calculation of energy consumption and potential energy savings"
resource-efficiency-potential-text-2: "To estimate the potential energy savings, a specific microcontroller and an estimate of the number of corresponding future IoT devices are used as examples:"
resource-efficiency-potential-list-1: "Microcontroller: Arduino Pro Mini (5 volts) with a power consumption of 22mA under full load and approx. 3.6mA in sleep mode"
resource-efficiency-potential-list-2: "Number of IoT devices: 10 billion microcontrollers are assumed for the estimate; estimates are for about 75 billion IoT devices in 2025"
resource-efficiency-potential-text-3: "This microcontroller has a yearly energy consumption of roughly <span class='font-italic'>(22, 1 · 24 ·365mAh·5V )/1000000 ≈ 0,97 kW/h</span> in normal mode and   (3, 6·24·365mAh·5V )/1000000 ≈ 0,16 kW/h  in sleep mode. Looking at 10 billion devices one can derive an annual energy consumption of <span class='font-italic'>7 TW/h</span> (normal mode) and <span class='font-italic'> 1.6 TW/h</span> (sleep mode). Assuming that more efficient implementations of AI techniques could result in a reduction of approximately 15mA per device (e.g., sleep mode, reduced data collection/transmission, etc.), a savings of approximately <span class='font-italic'>657 kW/h</span> per device per year could be achieved, analogous to the calculations above. For 10 billion devices worldwide, this would lead to a savings of approximately <span class='font-italic'>57 TW/h</span>, which corresponds to approximately 1.3% of Germany's net electricity consumption in the year 2020 (488 TWh)."
transparecy: "Höherer Transparenz über Ressourcenverbräuche von KI"
transparecy-text: "If a corresponding energy-saving implementation of AI processes succeeds on modern microcontrollers, this can enable self-sufficient battery-supported operation of the intelligent microcontrollers. As described above, the microcontrollers can be operated for several years under ideal circumstances. The direct resource and energy consumption can thus be estimated by the battery used and the runtime of the device. In this respect, the TinyAIoT project is expected to create an increased understanding and awareness of the resource consumption of AI processes in society."
relation-to-potential-risks: " Relation to potential negative environmental impacts "
relation-to-potential-risks-text: "The number of IoT applications as well as corresponding AI-based microcontrollers will increase dramatically in the future, both for direct applications to protect our environment and nature as well as for numerous economic applications (with possibly also positive environmental balance). However, increasing digitalization and especially more IoT applications will lead to additional energy consumption. In addition, more efficient implementations could lead to additional smart microcontrollers being used. However, it can be assumed that the implementation of corresponding scenarios will be largely determined by the economic benefits and not by energy consumption. In this respect, more efficient implementations are desirable in any case."
