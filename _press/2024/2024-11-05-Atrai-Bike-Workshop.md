"Atrai Bikes is revolutionizing urban safety and sustainability through an innovative senseBox:bike that captures environmental and traffic data. This citizen science initiative equips participants with tools to measure fine dust levels, temperature, and humidity while utilizing AI to predict vehicle passing maneuvers and road surfaces. A recent workshop brought Atrai Bikes to life, where participants were handed a senseBox:bike and guided through the setup of both the hardware and companion app. 52°North accompanied this workshop held in Germany’s unofficial biking capital city Münster with their project partners re:edu, also located in Münster, and Instituto Cordial from Brazil."
