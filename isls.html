      <h4>senseBox</h4>
      <p>The senseBox is a DIY-toolkit for building environmental monitoring stations. A custom
        designed microcontroller with simple connectors, which is Arduino compatible, makes it easy to setup the device
        and works without any software installation. Sensors for temperature, humidity, UV-light, luminance, air pressure,
        an accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope and a compass sensor are included in the senseBox:edu toolkit. Besides the
        sensors the senseBox:edu includes an OLED display, a microphone, ultrasonic distance sensor, and basic
        electronic components such as resistors or LEDs. For connecting the senseBox to the internet, it has an attachable
        WiFi Module which uses the Xbee-Standard. The senseBox is not a closed system, as there are more additional
        environmental sensors and data transmission modules available. There are sensors for particulate matter, water
        temperature, a GPS Module or soil moisture but also a LoRa, Ethernet, GSM or Bluetooth Modules for data
        transmission available. Data can also be collected on a SD-Card or directly sent to the openSenseMap.</p>

      <h4>openSenseMap</h4>
      <p>You can find the openSenseMap at <a href="https://opensensemap.org">https://opensensemap.org</a></p>
      <p>Locate yourself on the map and find the nearest sensor station to you. Grey boxes mean they are not online at the moment, green boxes have live data. </p>
